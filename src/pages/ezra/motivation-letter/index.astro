                    My journey into technology has always been driven by a single, powerful question: 
                    <strong>"How can I solve this user's frustration?"</strong> This focus on eliminating friction — 
                    rather than on code or aesthetics for their own sake — is what led me to apply for the 
                    MSc in Interaction Technology at the University of Twente.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My academic background in Computer Engineering provided a strong foundation in systematic 
                    thinking and technical execution. However, I discovered my true passion lies not in the 
                    algorithms themselves, but in designing/architecting the bridge between complex systems 
                    and the people who use them. This passion was further ignited during my thesis on Computer 
                    Vision, where I grew frustrated with the inefficiencies of Windows and macOS, particularly 
                    their poor access to CUDA. This led me to ultimately create an OS script, built on top of 
                    Linux, that automates the installation of a clean, efficient, and personalized operating 
                    desktop environment specialized and optimized for machine learning and computer vision, 
                    tackling the core issues encountered for my thesis and creating a reproducible system ready to use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This instinct to build solutions propelled me towards tackling societal challenges. During 
                    the Covid-19 pandemic, I co-founded <strong>Heal ID</strong>, a mobile application that 
                    bridges patients with medical evacuation services with the goal of simplifying healthcare 
                    through distributing patient's requests for ambulances through an application instead of a 
                    hotline. I later addressed mental wellness by creating <strong>WeFlect ID</strong>, a 
                    voice-based rapid journaling platform with the mission of accelerating wisdom and 
                    self-awareness through technology. While these ventures were successful in competitions, 
                    they revealed a critical gap: I was designing from intuition, lacking the framework to 
                    identify the most crucial problems to solve before building. I realized that without this, 
                    I risked creating 'super well-crafted statues' — application designs that win awards but 
                    ultimately sit on a shelf, failing to deliver lasting societal impact and resolve enduring issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is this precise gap that this programme is uniquely positioned to fill. I am particularly 
                    drawn to courses like <strong>"Human Centred Design"</strong> and 
                    <strong>"Experience Design for Interaction"</strong> to improve my intuition with a 
                    structured framework to solve the right problems. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary 
                    curriculum will be vital for my ultimate goal: to build an education journaling platform 
                    that leverages multimodal interaction (voice, text, gesture) and multi-agentic AI to create 
                    deeply personalized and adaptive learning and reflective experiences. I am eager to explore 
                    how these technologies can be harnessed to enhance learning experience in real-time making 
                    education not just digital, but intuitively human.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Upon graduation, I plan to work as a <strong>Product Designer or Engineer</strong> in a 
                    pioneering European tech startup, honing my skills and talent in applying design thinking 
                    methodologies to large-scale problems. This professional mastery is a crucial step toward 
                    my long-term goal of founding an education journaling platform. I aspire to act as a bridge 
                    between the Netherlands and Indonesia, bringing Dutch philosophy of pragmatic design to 
                    tackle educational inefficiencies and improve learning and reflective experiences in my home country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my practical experience, 
                    combined with the interactive education experience at the University of Twente, will enable 
                    me to evolve into a masterful designer of impactful solutions.
